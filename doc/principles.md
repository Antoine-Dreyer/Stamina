# General principles

This document describes the principles that should be followed for the development of the project.

## Automation and reproducibility

The input to all conversion programs will be as close as possible to a data set published by an authoritative source. The outputs will be directly uploadable in the database. Manual manipulation will be kept to a strict minimum.

All programs and scripts will be available and clearly documented so that they can be reused or adapted by others in order to produce additional content. The sources used are also precisely described, as well as where and how to obtain them.

## Open source

All programs developed in the project are open source and use only open source libraries. The programs are available publicly on GitHub under a MIT license.
