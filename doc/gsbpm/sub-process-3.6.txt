Test statistical business process
This sub-process describes the activities to manage a field test or pilot of the statistical business process. Typically it includes a small-scale data collection, to test collection instruments, followed by processing and analysis of the collected data, to ensure the statistical business process performs as expected. Following the pilot, it may be necessary to go back to a previous step and make adjustments to instruments, systems or components. For a major statistical business process, e.g. a population census, there may be several iterations until the process is working satisfactorily.
