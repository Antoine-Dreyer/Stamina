Design production systems and workflow
This sub-process determines the workflow from data collection to dissemination, taking an overview of all the processes required within the whole statistical production process, and ensuring that they fit together efficiently with no gaps or redundancies. Various systems and databases are needed throughout the process. A general principle is to reuse processes and technology across many statistical business processes, so existing production solutions (e.g. services, systems and databases) should be examined first, to determine whether they are fit for purpose for this specific process, then, if any gaps are identified, new solutions should be designed. This sub-process also considers how staff will interact with systems, and who will be responsible for what and when.
