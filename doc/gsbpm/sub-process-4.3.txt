Run collection
This sub-process is where the collection is implemented, with the different instruments being used to collect or gather the information, which may include raw micro-data or aggregates produced at the source, as well as any associated metadata. It includes the initial contact with providers and any subsequent follow-up or reminder actions. It may include manual data entry at the point of contact, or fieldwork management, depending on the source and collection mode. It records when and how providers were contacted, and whether they have responded. This sub-process also includes the management of the providers involved in the current collection, ensuring that the relationship between the statistical organisation and data providers remains positive, and recording and responding to comments, queries and complaints. For administrative and other non-statistical sources, this process is brief: the provider is either contacted to send the information, or sends it as scheduled. When the collection meets its targets, it is closed and a report on the collection is produced. Some basic validation of the structure and integrity of the information received may take place within this sub-process, e.g. checking that files are in the right format and contain the expected fields. All validation of the content takes place in the Process phase.
