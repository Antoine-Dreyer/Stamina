Evaluate
This phase manages the evaluation of a specific instance of a statistical business process, as opposed to the more general over-arching process of statistical quality management described in Section VI. It logically takes place at the end of the instance of the process, but relies on inputs gathered throughout the different phases. It includes evaluating the success of a specific instance of the statistical business process, drawing on a range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and identifying and prioritising potential improvements.
For statistical outputs produced regularly, evaluation should, at least in theory occur for each iteration, determining whether future iterations should take place, and if so, whether any improvements should be implemented. However, in some cases, particularly for regular and well established statistical business processes, evaluation may not be formally carried out for each iteration. In such cases, this phase can be seen as providing the decision as to whether the next iteration should start from the Specify Needs phase, or from some later phase (often the Collect phase).
This phase is made up of three sub-processes, which are generally sequential, from left to right, but which can overlap to some extent in practice. These sub-processes are:
