This phase collects or gathers all necessary information (data and metadata), using different collection modes (including extractions from statistical, administrative and other non-statistical registers and databases), and loads them into the appropriate environment for further processing. Whilst it can include validation of data set formats, it does not include any transformations of the data themselves, as these are all done in the "Process" phase. For statistical outputs produced regularly, this phase occurs in each iteration.
The "Collect" phase is broken down into four sub-processes, which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative. These sub-processes are:
