Finalise production systems
This sub-process includes the activities to put the assembled and configured processes and services, including modified and newly-created services into production ready for use by business areas. The activities include:
- producing documentation about the process components, including technical documentation and user manuals
- training the business users on how to operate the process
- moving the process components into the production environment, and ensuring they work as expected in that environment (this activity may also be part of sub-process 3.5 (Test production system)).
