Edit and impute
Where data are considered incorrect, missing or unreliable, new values may be inserted in this sub-process. The terms editing and imputation cover a variety of methods to do this, often using a rule-based approach. Specific steps typically include:
- the determination of whether to add or change data;
- the selection of the method to be used;
- adding / changing data values;
- writing the new data values back to the data set, and flagging them as changed;
- the production of metadata on the editing and imputation process.
