Build collection instrument
This sub-process describes the activities to build the collection instruments to be used during the "Collect" phase. The collection instrument is generated or built based on the design specifications created during the "Design" phase. A collection may use one or more modes to receive the data, e.g. personal or telephone interviews; paper, electronic or web questionnaires; SDMX hubs. Collection instruments may also be data extraction routines used to gather data from existing statistical or administrative data sets. This sub-process also includes preparing and testing the contents and functioning of that instrument (e.g. testing the questions in a questionnaire). It is recommended to consider the direct connection of collection instruments to the statistical metadata system, so that metadata can be more easily captured in the collection phase. Connection of metadata and data at the point of capture can save work in later phases. Capturing the metrics of data collection (paradata) is also an important consideration in this sub-process.
