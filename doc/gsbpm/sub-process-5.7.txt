Calculate aggregates
This sub process creates aggregate data and population totals from micro-data or lower-level aggregates. It includes summing data for records sharing certain characteristics, determining measures of average and dispersion, and applying weights from sub-process 5.6 to derive appropriate totals. In the case of sample surveys, sampling errors may also be calculated in this sub-process, and associated to the relevant aggregates.
