Review and validate
This sub-process examines data to try to identify potential problems, errors and discrepancies such as outliers, item non-response and miscoding. It can also be referred to as input data validation. It may be run iteratively, validating data against predefined edit rules, usually in a set order. It may flag data for automatic or manual inspection or editing. Reviewing and validating can apply to data from any type of source, before and after integration. Whilst validation is treated as part of the "Process" phase, in practice, some elements of validation may occur alongside collection activities, particularly for modes such as web collection. Whilst this sub-process is concerned with detection of actual or potential errors, any correction activities that actually change the data are done in sub-process 5.4.
