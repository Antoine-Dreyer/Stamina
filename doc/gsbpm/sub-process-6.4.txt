Apply disclosure control
This sub-process ensures that the data (and metadata) to be disseminated do not breach the appropriate rules on confidentiality. This may include checks for primary and secondary disclosure, as well as the application of data suppression or perturbation techniques. The degree and method of disclosure control may vary for different types of outputs, for example the approach used for micro-data sets for research purposes will be different to that for published tables or maps.
