Design collection
This sub-process determines the most appropriate collection method(s) and instrument(s). The actual activities in this sub-process will vary according to the type of collection instruments required, which can include computer assisted interviewing, paper questionnaires, administrative data interfaces and data integration techniques. This sub-process includes the design of collection instruments, questions and response templates (in conjunction with the variables and statistical classifications designed in sub-process 2.2 (Design variable descriptions)). It also includes the design of any formal agreements relating to data supply, such as memoranda of understanding, and confirmation of the legal basis for the data collection. This sub-process is enabled by tools such as question libraries (to facilitate the reuse of questions and related attributes), questionnaire tools (to enable the quick and easy compilation of questions into formats suitable for cognitive testing) and agreement templates (to help standardise terms and conditions). This sub-process also includes the design of process-specific provider management systems.
