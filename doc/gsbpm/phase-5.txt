Process
This phase describes the cleaning of data and their preparation for analysis. It is made up of sub-processes that check, clean, and transform input data, so that they can be analysed and disseminated as statistical outputs. It may be repeated several times if necessary. For statistical outputs produced regularly, this phase occurs in each iteration. The sub-processes in this phase can apply to data from both statistical and non-statistical sources (with the possible exception of sub-process 5.6 (Calculate weights), which is usually specific to survey data).
The "Process" and "Analyse" phases can be iterative and parallel. Analysis can reveal a broader understanding of the data, which might make it apparent that additional processing is needed. Activities within the "Process" and "Analyse" phases may commence before the "Collect" phase is completed. This enables the compilation of provisional results where timeliness is an important concern for users, and increases the time available for analysis.
This phase is broken down into eight sub-processes, which may be sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative. These sub-processes are:
