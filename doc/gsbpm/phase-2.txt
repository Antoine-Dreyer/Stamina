Design
This phase describes the development and design activities, and any associated practical research work needed to define the statistical outputs, concepts, methodologies, collection instruments1 and operational processes. It includes all the design elements needed to define or refine the statistical products or services identified in the business case.  This phase specifies all relevant metadata, ready for use later in the statistical business process, as well as quality assurance procedures. For statistical outputs produced on a regular basis, this phase usually occurs for the first iteration, and whenever improvement actions are identified in the Evaluate phase of a previous iteration.
Design activities make substantial use of international and national standards, in order to reduce the length and cost of the design process, and enhance to comparability and usability of outputs. Organisations are also encouraged to reuse or adapt design elements from existing processes. Additionally, outputs of design processes may form the basis for future standards at the organisation, national or international levels.
This phase is broken down into six sub-processes, which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative. These sub-processes are:
