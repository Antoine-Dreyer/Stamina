Design outputs
This sub-process contains the detailed design of the statistical outputs, products and services to be produced, including the related development work and preparation of the systems and tools used in the "Disseminate" phase. Disclosure control methods, as well as processes governing access to any confidential outputs are also designed here. Outputs should be designed to follow existing standards wherever possible, so inputs to this process may include metadata from similar or previous collections, international standards, and information about practices in other statistical organisations from sub-process 1.1 (Identify needs).
