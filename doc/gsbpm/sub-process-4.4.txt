Finalise collection
This sub-process includes loading the collected data and metadata into a suitable electronic environment for further processing. It may include manual or automatic data take-on, for example using clerical staff or optical character recognition tools to extract information from paper questionnaires, or converting the formats of files received from other organisations. It may also include analysis of the process metadata (paradata) associated with collection to ensure the collection activities have met requirements. In cases where there is a physical collection instrument, such as a paper questionnaire, which is not needed for further processing, this sub-process manages the archiving of that material.
