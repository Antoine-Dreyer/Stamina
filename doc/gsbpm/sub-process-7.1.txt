Update output systems
This sub-process manages the update of systems where data and metadata are stored ready for dissemination purposes, including:
- formatting data and metadata ready to be put into output databases;
- loading data and metadata into output databases;
- ensuring data are linked to the relevant metadata.
Formatting, loading and linking of metadata should preferably mostly take place in earlier phases, but this sub-process includes a final check that all of the necessary metadata are in place ready for dissemination.
