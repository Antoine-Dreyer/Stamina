Establish output objectives
This sub-process identifies the statistical outputs that are required to meet the user needs identified in sub-process 1.2 (Consult and confirm needs). It includes agreeing the suitability of the proposed outputs and their quality measures with users. Legal frameworks (e.g. relating to confidentiality), and available resources are likely to be constraints when establishing output objectives.
