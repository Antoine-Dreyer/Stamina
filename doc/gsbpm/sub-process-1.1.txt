Identify Needs
This sub-process includes the initial investigation and identification of what statistics are needed and what is needed of the statistics. It may be triggered by a new information request, an environmental change such as a reduced budget. Action plans from evaluations of previous iterations of the process, or from other processes, might provide an input to this sub-process. It also includes consideration of practice amongst other (national and international) statistical organisations producing similar data, and in particular the methods used by those organisations. It may involve consideration of specific needs of different user communities, such as the disabled, or different ethnic groups.
