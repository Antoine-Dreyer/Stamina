Design variable descriptions
This sub-process defines the statistical variables to be collected via the collection instrument, as well as any other variables that will be derived from them in sub-process 5.5 (Derive new variables and units), and any statistical classifications that will be used. It is expected that existing national and international standards will be followed wherever possible. This sub-process may need to run in parallel with sub-process 2.3 (Design collection), as the definition of the variables to be collected, and the choice of collection instrument may be inter-dependent to some degree. Preparation of metadata descriptions of collected and derived variables and classifications is a necessary precondition for subsequent phases.
