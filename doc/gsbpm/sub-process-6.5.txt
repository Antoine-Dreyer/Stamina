Finalise outputs
This sub-process ensures the statistics and associated information are fit for purpose and reach the required quality level, and are thus ready for use. It includes:
- completing consistency checks;
- determining the level of release, and applying caveats;
- collating supporting information, including interpretation, commentary, technical notes, briefings, measures of uncertainty and any other necessary metadata;
- producing the supporting internal documents;
- pre-release discussion with appropriate internal subject matter experts;
- approving the statistical content for release.
